# TASK 

1. React and Node.js Full Stack Task with Authentication:

- Task: Develop a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with user authentication features.

- Users should be able to register, log in, and perform authenticated actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting their data.

- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and ensure proper validation and error handling throughout the application.

- Create a public repository and deploy the project.

# Install Dependencies in both Client and Server: 

Before running the server, make sure you have installed all the required dependencies. In the root directory of your project, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

`npm install`

Set Up MongoDB: Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. 

`If not, download and install MongoDB from the official website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and start the MongoDB server.`

# Start the Server: 

Run the backend server by executing the `index.js` file

For example:

`node index.js`

Run the frontend Server

`npm start`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message "Server Started Successfully" in the console, indicating that the server is up and running.

Now, you can test the backend server by sending requests from your frontend application or using tools like Postman. 

Since the frontend is running on http://localhost:3000, it should be able to communicate with the backend, The CORS configuration allowing requests from that origin.
